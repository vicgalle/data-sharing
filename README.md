There are two main notebooks:

* [data_sharing_decentralized.ipynb](https://github.com/vicgalle/data-sharing/blob/main/data_sharing_decentralized.ipynb) for the experiments in Section 4.1, using the decentralized framework.

* [Regulator_Experiments.ipynb](https://github.com/vicgalle/data-sharing/blob/main/Regulator_Experiments.ipynb) for the experiments in Section 4.1, using the centralized framework via the Regulator.
